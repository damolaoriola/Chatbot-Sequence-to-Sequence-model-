# Chatbot-Sequence-to-Sequence-model-
In this project, I trained a conversational fun chatbot trained on the Cornell dataset movie dialogs containing fictional conversations.
An RNN Encoder-Decoder deep learning model with attention was applied to enable the chatbot pick on language patterns and respond to statements.
